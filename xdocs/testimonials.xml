            We are using MINA at a telco to route low level protocol packets
            to a third party.  We already had a SOAP and also a CORBA interface
            but for speed purposes we are trying out a lower level protocol and
            we needed a gateway of sorts to route messages between our cluster of
            servers and the third party's servers.

            I had been planning on using NIO and some aspects of
            <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/proj/seda/">SEDA</a> but
            finding MINA was a real treat as it saved a lot of time, is well
            written and gets more testing than our in house QA would be able to
            cover.
          </p>
          <p>
            The speed and stability of our app on top of MINA has been excellent.

          What a fantastic API! Definately the best I've seen since
          <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html">Doug Lea's Concurrency API</a>.

          We are using it for the network layer of
          <a href="http://www.osflash.org/red5">Red5</a>, an open source flash
          server. At the moment we have RTMP and AMF working and hope to add
          more protocols in the future.  MINA's design and ease of use has
          helped us get a prototype up and running quickly.

            We use MINA to communicate with
            <a href="http://www.banksys.com/">Banksys</a> 'point of sale'
            terminals (Visa, Mastercard...) for technical management operations.
            (software upgrade, remote monitoring, log transfer...)
          </p>
          <p>
            So far, MINA has worked really well for us. We used
            <a href="http://gleamynode.net/dev/tl-netty2/docs/">Netty2</a>,
            and clearly saw the improvements in MINA. I like the MINA API
            more. MINA really makes it easier to write applications using NIO.
